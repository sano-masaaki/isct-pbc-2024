# 5. Advanced api development

## Customize API

### Specifying search conditions for the API to retrieve a list
Let's make it possible to retrieve a list of pets by specifying their names as search conditions in the API for retrieving a list of pets created in the previous lecture.

- Modify `src/app/api/pets/route.ts` as follows.
  - Add `import { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'`.
  - Modify the `GET /api/pets` API as follows.
    ```ts
    // GET /api/pets
    export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
      const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams
      const queryName = searchParams.get('name')
      // findMany returns a list of records.
      const pets = await prisma.pet.findMany({
        // sort by id ascending
        orderBy: { id: 'asc' },
        // select only id, name, imageUrl, and owner.name
        select: { id: true, name: true, imageUrl: true, owner: { select: { name: true } } },
        where: queryName ? { name: { contains: queryName } } : undefined,
      })
      // return Response with pets to json
      return NextResponse.json({ pets })
    }
    ```
Diff will be as follows.

- Add the following to `request.http` and run SendRequest.
  - `?name=MIAO` will be the search keyword for name.


```
### search pets by name
GET {{baseUrl}}/pets?name=MIAO HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

![](images/2023-11-25-07-36-27.png)

- If Response shows pets whose names contain the search keyword, it is OK.

## Authentication
Let's implement the authentication function using Supabase.

### Preparing to use Supabase's authentication functionality
- Open Project Settings > API in Supabase and copy the Project URL and Project API key (anon public)
![](images/2023-11-25-02-06-02.png)
- Open .env in Visual Studio Code and add the following two lines

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<Project URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<Project API key(anon public)>
```

![](images/2023-11-24-10-51-23.png)

- Install Supabase libraries for authentication

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

- Add a file named `supabaseClient.ts` under the `lib` folder and copy the following code.

```ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  throw new Error('')
}
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
```

![](images/2023-11-25-02-29-52.png)

You are now ready to use the Supabase authentication feature.

### Signup
First of all, you need to enable Signup.

- Create a `signup` folder under `src/app/api`, create a file `route.ts` in it, and paste the following code.

```ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import { supabase } from '../../../../lib/supabaseClient'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const requestUrl = new URL(request.url)
  const data = await request.json()
  const email = String(data.email)
  const password = String(data.password)

  const authResponse = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
    options: {
      emailRedirectTo: `${requestUrl.origin}/auth/callback`,
    },
  })

  return NextResponse.json(authResponse)
}
```

![](images/2023-11-25-02-48-45.png)

- Add the following to `request.http`, rewrite the email and password values, and then execute SendRequest.

```
### signup
POST {{baseUrl}}/signup HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>",
  "password": "<ANY PASSWORD>"
}
```

![](images/2023-11-25-02-55-40.png)

- If you see a Response like the following, it is OK.
![](images/2023-11-25-03-00-03.png)

- Open Authentication > Users in Supabase and you will see that the user is registered.
![](images/2023-11-25-03-00-38.png)

- Click Confirm your mail in received email.

![](images/2023-11-25-03-03-11.png)

- You will be redirected to a screen like this, but since you have not created an application screen, this is OK.
![](images/2023-11-25-03-03-05-23.png)

- If you open Authentication > Users in Supabase again, you will see that the Last Sign In value has changed from `Waiting for verification` to the date and time you clicked Confirm your mail in the email.
![](images/2023-11-25-03-08-38.png)

### Signin
Next, we will make it possible to Signin.

- Create a `signin` folder under `src/app/api`, create a file `route.ts` in it, and paste the following code.

```ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import { supabase } from '../../../../lib/supabaseClient'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await request.json()
  const email = String(data.email)
  const password = String(data.password)

  const authTokenResponse = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email,
    password,
  })

  return NextResponse.json(authTokenResponse.data.session)
}
```

![](images/2023-11-25-03-27-36.png)

- Add the following to `request.http`, rewrite the email and password values, and then execute SendRequest.

```
### signin
POST {{baseUrl}}/signin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>",
  "password": "<ANY PASSWORD>"
}
```

![](images/2023-11-25-03-21-14.png)

- If you see a response similar to the one below, you are good to go.
  - The access_token in the response contains information necessary for identification, and this is used to confirm that the user has been authenticated.
![](images/2023-11-25-03-28-36.png)


- Note: User information can be obtained by decoding access_token.
  - Site where you can decode: https://jwt.io/

## Uploading files
Create an API that allows you to upload image files.

### Creating a bucket (file storage location)
- In Supabase, select Storage > New Bucket.
![](images/2023-11-24-10-00-33.png)

- Enter `learning-phase` in Name of bucket, turn on Public bucket and Save.

![](images/2023-11-24-10-02-06.png)

### Policy settings
In the initial state, file upload is not allowed in the security settings, so add a permission setting.

- Open Policies and click the NewPolicy button to the right of learning-phase.
![](images/2023-11-24-10-04-36.png)

- Select For full customization.

![](images/2023-11-24-10-05-10.png)

- Set as follows
  - Policy name: allow-all
  - Allowed operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  - Target roles: Default
  - Policy definition: Default

![](images/2023-11-25-04-37-27.png)


### Image Upload API
- Create a `images` folder under `src/app/api`, create a file `route.ts` in it, and paste the following code.

```ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import { supabase } from '../../../../lib/supabaseClient'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const formData = await request.formData()
  const file = formData.get('file') as File

  const response = await supabase.storage
    .from('learning-phase') // target bucket name
    .upload(file.name, file)

  return NextResponse.json(response)
}
```

![](images/2023-11-25-05-50-29.png)

- Create an images folder and save the images you wish to upload. Any images are acceptable.

![](images/2023-11-25-05-58-50.png)

- Add the following to `request.http`, rewrite values of YOUR FILE NAME and YOUR FILE PATH, and then execute SendRequest.

```
### upload image
POST {{baseUrl}}/images HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=MyBoundary

--MyBoundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="<YOUR FILE NAME>"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

< <YOUR FILE PATH>
--MyBoundary--
```

![](images/2023-11-25-06-01-23.png)

- If you see a Response like the following, you are OK.
![](images/2023-11-25-06-04-35.png)

- You can confirm that the images are stored in the learning-phase bucket of Supabase.
![](images/2023-11-25-06-05-03.png)

### Exercise: API to get a list of images
Let's create an API to get a list of files in the learning-phase bucket using this list method.
https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-list

![](images/2023-11-25-06-24-20.png)

Tip: All Parameters passed to the list method are Optional, so you can omit them and use `list()`.

## Deploy to the application on Vercel
Commit and Push your changes. By doing so, you can deploy the changes to the app on Vercel.
